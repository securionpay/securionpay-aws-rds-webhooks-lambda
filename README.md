# SecurionPay AWS - RDS Webhooks Lambda

This Lambda can be used to synchronize data from your SecurionPay account to the MySQL database server.

Once the data is imported into MySQL database, it is possible to:
- easily run custom SQL queries to answer common business questions (i.e. What is my current chargeback ratio?)
- use business intelligence tools (like [AWS QuickSight](https://quicksight.aws/)) to analyze and visualize your data
- and much more...  


## High level overview

Hereâ€™s the most common setup for using Lambda from this repository:
- Transactions (and other objects like customer, chargebacks, ...) are created in SecurionPay during regular payment processing
- SecurionPay is configured to send webhook events to AWS Kinesis stream
- Lambda (of which code is provided in this repository) is configured to pull data from AWS Kinesis stream and save it to MySQL database server (hosted via AWS RDS)
- The MySQL server contains copy of all data from SecurionPay (with near real-time synchronization)

- Click "Next: Permissions"
- Search for IAM Policy created in step 3 and select it
- Click "Next: Review"
- Fill in "Name" with a descriptive name for you new role (for example, "SecurionPay-webhooks-access")
